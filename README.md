## **🇰🇷 Korean Grammatical Norm Generation (RAG-based)**
2025 NIKL Task: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Korean Language Norm Compliance

### 🧾 Overview

This repository contains research code and documentation for the Korean Language Norm Generation Task,
part of the 2025 National Institute of Korean Language (NIKL) Benchmark Challenge.

The task involves selecting or correcting Korean expressions in accordance with official grammar and orthographic norms (e.g., spacing rules, auxiliary verbs, foreign word spelling), and generating answers with appropriate reasoning based on regulatory sources.

The system is designed under Self-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation without external data) constraints.


### 🏁 Goal

Build a faithful, explainable, and regulation-compliant language generation system
within a closed-data environment.
